# Exercise-01d-Basic-Game-Loop
Exercise for MSCH-C220, 1 February 2021

A video demonstration of this exercise is available here: [https://youtu.be/NsJfGe-0Ns4](https://youtu.be/NsJfGe-0Ns4).

This exercise is an opportunity for you to create a (simple) interactive-fiction game engine in Python. Ultimately, your responsibility will be to complete the update, render, and get_input functions in main.py; I plan to take significant time in class to walk through that process step-by-step.

As usual, the first step is to Fork the repository. When that process has completed, make sure that the top of the repository reads [your username]/Exercise-01d-Basic-Game-Loop.

Edit the LICENSE and replace BL-MSCH-C220-S21 with your full name. Commit your changes.

Press the green "Code" button and select "Open in GitHub Desktop". Allow the browser to open (or install) GitHub Desktop. Once GitHub Desktop has loaded, you should see a window labeled "Clone a Repository" asking you for a Local Path on your computer where the project should be copied. Choose a location where you will keep the repositories for this class (a C220 folder off your Desktop would be fine). Make sure the Local Path ends with "Exercise-01d-Basic-Game-Loop" and then press the "Clone" button. GitHub Desktop will now download a copy of the repository to the location you indicated.

Open Visual Studio Code, and select File->Open. Navigate to the repository folder you just cloned, select the folder, and press "Open".

In the far right (black) panel of the window, you should see five icons. The top one is File Explorer. If that is selected, you should see five files listed: .gitignore, adventure.json, LICENSE, main.py, and README.md.

Open main.py. If you haven't already installed the Python plugin, do so now.

In the middle of the program, you should see two commented lines (# -------------------------). Between these two lines are the three functions of the game loop. Your assignement is to complete these so the game's description is displayed, the player can choose from the available options, and the choice is reflected in a change of the game's state.

Again, I plan to go through this program in great detail, and to demonstrate the implementation of this exercise.

When you are done, test the game. Does it work as you would expect? 

Save these files and quit Visual Studio Code. In GitHub Desktop, you should now see main.py highlighted. Add a Summary message at the bottom of that panel, and push the "Commit to master" button. On the right side of the top, black panel, you should see a button labeled "Push origin". Press that now.

If you return to and refresh your GitHub repository page, you should now see that your files have been changed (with a new date).

Now edit the README.md file. When you have finished editing, commit your changes, and then turn in the URL of the main repository page (https://github.com/[username]/Exercise-01d-Basic-Game-Loop) on Canvas.

The final state of the file should be as follows (replacing my information with yours):
